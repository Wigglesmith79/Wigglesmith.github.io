            I don't think most people really have favorites, so here is a list of media that I just think is great.
        </p>


        <p>
            We will go over <strong>Games, Movies/TV, Board Games and Music</strong>,
            <strong><em>History</em></strong>

            <em>Games</em>
            When I was young we had a Game Cube but that didnt last long, we mainly played Medal Of Honor, Rising
            Sun
            and
            Mario Cart. Then we got Minecraft and I've played it off and on in the years since. But, it was
            only when I was about 16 that I found out that indie games existed from the YouTube channel, GMTK, and
            made
            the
            mistake
            of playing Hollow knight as my first real single player video game, and the rest is history.

            <em>Movies/TV</em>
            Like most people, movies were just a part of my life since I was a child.

            <em>Music</em>
            I don't tend to like music as much as others but I am still human and enjoy a good song, I was raised on
            showtoons and hymns, because I am Christain and my Dad has always been in theatre.

                            <li>Nobody was told no in the artist room, the movie has some of the craziest visuals in

                                mainstream animated movie</li>

                                good. It's a wonderful memory of just hanging out with my Dad.</li>

                            <li>The charcters are extremly expressive and consistant, but they also grow over the
                                series,
                                its a joy to watch.</li>

                    <li>Deaths Door <ul>

                            <li><q>Death's Door is a 3D, isometric action-adventure game. The player starts with a
                                    sword,
                                    and

                                    and
                                    arrow. Sword strikes string together into combos and ammo for the bow is
                                    replenished
                                    by
                                    using

                                    sword. Four other weapons and three magic projectiles become available as the
                                    game
                                    progresses</q>- wikipedia</li>
                            <li>You wont find this on many top games list but its near the top on mine, it is just
                                fun
                                and
                                not
                                too
                                hard to make me want to put the game down, something I dealt with several times in
                                Hollow
                                Knight.
                                The combat is tight and simple, the exploration is optional but rewarding, making it
                                very
                                replayable. The visuals all just support the gamplay, only one attack in the entire
                                game
                                felt
                                bad/ unfair to me.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>


            </li>

            <li>Spiderheck <ul>
                    <li>This the one piece of media that has given me the most fun and laughs out of any other, you
                        start
                        feeling like a newborn giraffe and end like John Wick. The physics baised gameplay make
                        things
                        fun
                        and goofy but also consistant so you can master them. Spiderheck also has tons of
                        customizability
                        keeping it fresh for years</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Downwell
                <ul>
                    <li> Downwell is a mobile game with random level generation, permadeath and upgrades that has a
                        vertical format where you fall down a hole stomping and shooting enemies building up a combo
                        and
                        getting upgrades. The game has extreemly tight design, because nothing is waisted and every
                        game
                        elemnt including the art has multiple uses. its is the only game that I am actually good at,
                        I've
                        beat it on normal and hard modes.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <Li>Valheim <ul>
                    <li>Valheim is a survival crafting game with a viking theme and a early 2000s low-poly style.
                        The
                        game
                        has pretty good progresion and a great building system where things you build actually look
                        good.
                        When I first played the game it was the first game in a long time that had me thinking about
                        it
                        while I wasent playing it.

                                buy
                                and
                                play the game.</li>

                            <li>One of the things I like best in a song is that it changes and is not to repetitive
                                and
                                I
                                think this song nails it. I just love musicals </li>

                            <li>This song is very thematic and says quite a lot through the lyrics, but really just
                                sounds
                                good
