        Downwell is a <dfn title="Rougelike"> mobile game with random level generation, permadeath and upgrades</dfn>
        that has a vertical format where you fall down
        a hole stomping
        and shooting
        enemies building up a combo and getting upgrades.
        The game has <em>extreemly</em> tight design, because nothing is waisted and every game elemnt including the art
        has multiple uses

                Downwell uses a palette of four colors, which default to black background and white outlines, with red
                as a
                highlight for gems, enemies and other important items, and blue for water environment features.[2][3]
                The
                exact
                colors can be changed through unlockable in-game palettes.[4] The art style and underground level design
                have
                been compared to Spelunky and Cave Story.[5]

        Take the gun pickups, these have both a new gun and a health or ammo pickup but they can also function a way to
        nerf the player/change up gamplay, whenever a <abbr title="Gun with bad range and changing accuracy">
            Nopy</abbr> comes up, if you
        want the health or ammo you need to live with an inferior gun until the next pickup <strong>and</strong> the
        upgrade room is a way to rest on the ground without taking damage and keeping your combo

        other game elements making one of the tightest, most cohesive games ever made.
